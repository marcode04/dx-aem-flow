Enterprise AI development platform for teams shipping on Azure DevOps and Atlassian. 70+ skills that run identically across **Claude Code**, **GitHub Copilot CLI**, and **VS Code Chat** — from ticket to PR, fully autonomous. Deep AEM specialization built in.

## Why This Exists

Enterprise teams run complex sprints across multiple repos, multiple IDEs, and multiple team members. They need a system that handles the full lifecycle — requirements analysis, implementation planning, code generation, testing, verification, documentation, and PR creation — with governance at every step. Without re-explaining the project every session.

KAI is a structured development workflow built as a plugin system for enterprise teams. It encodes your entire sprint lifecycle — requirements, planning, execution, review, PR — into **skills** that orchestrate multi-agent pipelines across every major AI platform. A single command like `/dx-req-all` pulls the ticket from Azure DevOps or Jira, validates readiness against your DoR, distills developer requirements, researches the codebase with parallel subagents, and generates a team summary. Each skill chains specialized agents (Opus for deep review, Sonnet for execution, Haiku for lookups), gathers context from multiple sources (tickets, config, codebase, Figma designs, live AEM content), and writes structured output that the next skill picks up automatically.

**What makes it different:**
- **Every AI platform** — same 70+ skills work identically in Claude Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, and VS Code Chat. Same plugins, same config, same results — regardless of which IDE your team uses.
- **Enterprise governance** — DoR validation, 6-phase verification gate (compile, lint, test, secret scan, architecture review, AI code review), autonomous PR review, and branch protection. Ship with confidence.
- **AEM full-flow** — the deepest AI-powered AEM tooling available. Figma → component → dialog inspection → JCR content → editorial QA → browser automation → demo capture. The complete AEM development lifecycle.
- **Config-driven, not prompt-driven** — your build commands, branch names, and conventions live in one config file. Every skill reads it. No hardcoded values, no repeated instructions.
- **Persistent memory between steps** — each skill writes structured output to local files. The next skill picks it up automatically. Sessions can end and resume without losing context.
- **Autonomous mode** — the same skills that run locally also run unattended as ADO pipeline agents, triggered by webhooks. Tag a ticket, get a verified bugfix with a PR.

## Install

Add the marketplace, then install the plugins you need:

```bash
# Add the marketplace (once)
/plugin marketplace add easingthemes/dx-aem-flow

# Install plugins
/plugin install dx-core@dx-aem-flow   # Core workflow (all projects)
/plugin install dx-hub@dx-aem-flow              # Multi-repo orchestration (optional)
/plugin install dx-aem@dx-aem-flow              # AEM tools (AEM projects)
/plugin install dx-automation@dx-aem-flow        # Autonomous agents (24/7 pipelines)
```

From a local clone:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/dx-aem-flow
/plugin install dx-core@dx-aem-flow
```

## Plugins

### [dx-core](plugins/dx-core/) — Development Workflow

Full-stack development workflow for Azure DevOps and Jira projects: requirements gathering, implementation planning, step-by-step execution with testing and review, code review, bug fixes, and PR management.

**42 skills, 6 agents.** Works with any tech stack.

### [dx-hub](plugins/dx-hub/) — Multi-Repo Orchestration

Hub directory management for coordinating work across multiple consumer repos — init, config, status.

**3 skills.**

### [dx-aem](plugins/dx-aem/) — AEM Full-Flow

The complete AEM development lifecycle: component dialog inspection, JCR content, page authoring, editorial QA with browser automation, snapshot/verify lifecycle, and demo capture. The deepest AI-powered AEM tooling available.

**12 skills, 6 agents.** Requires dx plugin.

### [dx-automation](plugins/dx-automation/) — Autonomous Agents

Autonomous AI agents (DoR checker, DoD checker, DoD fixer, PR reviewer, PR answerer, BugFix agent, QA agent, DevAgent, DOCAgent) running 24/7 as ADO pipelines triggered by AWS Lambda webhooks.

**11 skills.** Requires dx plugin.

## Client-Specific Plugins

Client-specific plugins can live alongside these plugins for project-specific enrichment (market data, brand config, etc.). See the [authoring guide](https://easingthemes.github.io/dx-aem-flow/contributing/authoring/) for how to create them.

## Quick Start

### With Claude Code (interactive)

```bash
# 1. Install
/plugin marketplace add easingthemes/dx-aem-flow
/plugin install dx-core@dx-aem-flow

# 2. Initialize your project
/dx-init

# 3. Work on a story
/dx-req-all 2416553        # Fetch story, distill requirements, research codebase
/dx-plan                    # Generate implementation plan
/dx-step-all                # Execute all steps autonomously
/dx-step-build              # Build & deploy
/dx-step-verify             # 6-phase verification
/dx-pr                      # Create pull request
```

### Without Claude Code (standalone scaffold)

For users who don't have Claude Code, the CLI utility creates the same project structure with default values:

```bash
# From a clone of this repo:
node dx/cli/bin/dx-scaffold.js /path/to/your-project --all

# Flags: --aem (AEM files), --copilot (Copilot agents), --all (both)
```

Auto-detects git remote, SCM provider, project type, and base branch. Outputs ~144 files with TODO placeholders — edit `.ai/config.yaml` afterwards. See [cli/README.md](cli/README.md) for details.
