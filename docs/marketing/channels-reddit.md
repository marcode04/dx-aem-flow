# Reddit Strategy

## Golden Rule
**90/10 ratio** — 90% genuine contributions, 10% subtle mentions. Build karma for 2-4 weeks before ANY promotion. Use a personal username, never a brand account.

## Subreddit Tiers

### Tier 1: Self-Promotion Friendly (Start Here)

| Subreddit | Members | Rules | Post Angle |
|-----------|---------|-------|------------|
| **r/SideProject** | 503K | Welcomes project sharing | "I built an AI dev platform with dozens of skills — here's my journey" |
| **r/coolgithubprojects** | 60K | GitHub repos welcome | Direct repo link + description |
| **r/alphaandbetausers** | 22K | Early testers wanted | "Looking for beta testers for an open-source AI dev toolkit" |
| **r/shamelessplug** | 52K | Explicitly for promotion | Direct pitch |
| **r/IMadeThis** | 18K | Builder showcase | "I made an AI platform that turns tickets into PRs" |

### Tier 2: High-Value, Strict Rules (Engage First)

| Subreddit | Members | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **r/programming** | 6.6M | Spend 2 weeks commenting helpfully. Post technical deep-dive, not product pitch. |
| **r/webdev** | 2.4M | Answer questions about dev workflows. Share as "tool I use." |
| **r/devops** | 300K+ | Contribute to CI/CD discussions. Share automation insights. |
| **r/SaaS** | — | Discuss build strategy, not product features. |
| **r/Entrepreneur** | 4.8M | "Here's how I built and launched an open-source dev tool" |

### Tier 3: AI & Niche Communities

| Subreddit | Angle |
|-----------|-------|
| **r/ClaudeAI** | "I built a plugin system for Claude Code — dozens of skills for enterprise dev" |
| **r/ChatGPTCoding** | "What if your AI assistant could handle the entire sprint, not just coding?" |

Title: I built 73 structured AI skills for enterprise dev workflows — consistent output, not raw suggestions

Hey r/SideProject!

Every dev team uses AI now — Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code. But on
enterprise projects I kept seeing the same problem: raw AI output is
inconsistent. Quality depends on the prompt, there's no process
discipline, no audit trail, no verification.

So I built dx-aem-flow — 4 plugins with 73 structured skills that
produce consistent, enterprise-quality output from ticket to PR.

What makes it different from raw AI tools:
- Structured artifacts at every step (requirements, plans, verification reports)
- Config-driven: one YAML file, consistent results across the whole team
- 6-phase verification gate (compile, lint, test, secrets, architecture, AI review)
- 10 autonomous agents enforcing quality in Azure DevOps pipelines 24/7
- Same skills on Claude Code, Copilot CLI, and VS Code Chat
- Pure markdown — no build system, no Docker
- Open source

The key insight: the gap in AI dev tools isn't intelligence — it's structure.

Would love feedback from anyone working with enterprise dev workflows!

Title: How I set up 10 autonomous AI agents running 24/7 on Azure DevOps pipelines

I've been building an autonomous development system where AI agents
handle routine dev tasks without human intervention.

The setup:
- AWS Lambda webhooks listen for ADO events
- When a ticket is tagged or PR is created, Lambda triggers an ADO pipeline
- The pipeline runs a Claude Code agent with specific skills
- Agent does the work (review PR, fix bug, validate DoD, etc.)
- Results posted back to ADO as comments/PRs

Currently running these agents:
1. PR Reviewer — reviews diffs, posts structured comments
2. PR Answerer — responds to reviewer questions with codebase context
3. DoR Checker — validates requirements before dev starts
4. DoD Checker — validates completion criteria before merge
5. BugFix Agent — triage → reproduce → fix → PR
6. DevAgent — full ticket → PR automation
...and more.

All powered by open-source skills (pure markdown, no build system).

Happy to share the architecture details if anyone's interested in
setting up something similar.

## Comment Strategy

Before posting your own content:
1. **Search for relevant questions** — "AI development workflow", "automated PR review", "Azure DevOps automation"
2. **Answer genuinely** with helpful detail
3. **Mention your tool only when directly relevant** — "I actually built something for this..."
4. **Never copy-paste the same comment** across subreddits

---

## Timing
- Best posting times: Weekday mornings (US Eastern time)
- Avoid weekends for promotional posts
- Engage in comments within the first 2 hours (Reddit's algorithm favors early engagement)
