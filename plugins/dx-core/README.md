# dx-core — Development Workflow Plugin for Claude Code

A comprehensive development workflow plugin for Azure DevOps and Jira projects. Covers the entire lifecycle: requirements gathering, implementation planning, step-by-step execution with testing and review, code review, bug fixes, and PR management. Works with any tech stack — pair with the [aem](https://github.com/yourorg/claude-aem) plugin for AEM projects.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add easingthemes/dx-aem-flow
/plugin install dx-core@dx-aem-flow
```

## Quick Start

```bash
/dx-init                    # One-time project setup — generates .ai/config.yaml
/dx-req-all 2416553         # Fetch work item (ADO/Jira), distill requirements, research codebase
/dx-plan                    # Generate step-by-step implementation plan
/dx-step-all                # Execute all steps autonomously (test + review + commit loop)
/dx-step-build                   # Build & deploy, auto-fix errors
/dx-step-verify             # 6-phase verification before shipping
/dx-pr                      # Create pull request
```

## Agents

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|

| `dx-doc-searcher` | Haiku | Local documentation index search |
| `dx-step-executor` | Sonnet | Skill delegation loop for autonomous execution |

## Configuration

`/dx-init` generates `.ai/config.yaml` in your project root:

```yaml
project:
  name: "My Project"
  prefix: "myproject"

scm:
  provider: ado
  org: https://myorg.visualstudio.com/
  project: "My Project"
  repo-id: "uuid"
  base-branch: develop

build:
  command: "mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage"
  test: "mvn test"
  lint-js: "npm run lint:js"
  lint-css: "npm run lint:css"
```

## Customization

### Config overrides

Add an `overrides:` section to `.ai/config.yaml` for simple tweaks:

```yaml
overrides:
  pr-review:
    tone: "direct, no praise"
    severity-threshold: 80
  pr-answer:
    persona: "senior developer, brief responses"
```

### Shared rules

`/dx-init` installs shared rules to `.ai/rules/`. Edit these to customize behavior for both local dx skills and automation agents:

| File | What it controls |
|------|-----------------|
| `.ai/rules/pr-review.md` | PR review criteria and comment format |
| `.ai/rules/pr-answer.md` | PR answer tone and response categories |
| `.ai/rules/pragmatism.md` | Pragmatism filter for plans and questions |
| `.ai/rules/plan-format.md` | Implementation plan template |

Precedence: `.ai/rules/<topic>.md` > `config.yaml overrides` > plugin defaults.

### Skill shadowing

Create a skill with the same name in your project's `.claude/skills/` to override any plugin skill entirely.
