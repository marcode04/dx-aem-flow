You detect the project's technical profile from source files and update `.ai/config.yaml` with the `project:`, `toolchain:`, and additional `build:` fields. Then you substitute the detected values into `.claude/rules/` files (replacing generic placeholders with real project values).

Use ultrathink — project detection requires reading multiple source files and making accurate inferences.

## 0. Check Prerequisites

Read `.ai/config.yaml`. If it doesn't exist: "Run `/dx-init` first." STOP.

Check if `.ai/config.yaml` already has a `project:` section with `type` field:
- **If no `project:` section:** Go directly to Phase 1. (This is normal on first run or when called from `dx-init`.)
- **If `project:` section exists:** Display the current values and ask: **(A) Keep as-is**, **(B) Re-detect** (re-reads source files), **(C) Edit** (re-confirm with current values pre-loaded). If A: skip to Phase 4 (rule substitution only).

## Phase 1: Detect Project Type

### 1a. Auto-detect (or use argument)

If the user provided an argument (`aem-fullstack`, `aem-frontend`, `frontend`), use it. Otherwise detect:

| Check | Type |
|---|---|
| `pom.xml` exists AND contains `com.adobe.cq` or AEM `uber-jar` dependency | `aem-fullstack` |
| `pom.xml` exists AND contains `content-package-maven-plugin` AND no Java source in `src/main/java/` | `aem-frontend` |
| `package.json` exists AND contains `aem-clientlib-generator` or `clientlib.config.js` exists | `aem-frontend` |
| `package.json` exists AND no AEM indicators | `frontend` |
| Only `pom.xml` (no AEM) | `java` |

### 1b. Extract details per project type

**For `aem-fullstack`:**

```bash
# Find Java package root
find . -path "*/src/main/java/*.java" | head -1
# → extract package from first line of that file

# Find component namespace from filter.xml or .content.xml
grep -r "componentGroup" --include="*.xml" -l | head -5

# Find base branch
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'

# Find Maven modules
find . -maxdepth 3 -name "pom.xml" | grep -v "^./pom.xml"
```

Read 2-3 `.content.xml` files with `componentGroup` to extract:
- `componentGroup` — the group name string (e.g., `"MyProject General"`)
- `componentPath` — derive from the file path (e.g., `/apps/myproject/components`)
- `componentSelector` — from `@Exporter` annotation in any Java `@Model` class
- `serviceVendor` — from `@Component(property = "service.vendor=...")` in any Java class
- `dialogPropertyPrefix` — check if dialog XML uses `./data/` nesting or `./` directly
- `rteInheritancePath` — search for `sling:resourceSuperType` containing `rteConfigs`
- `authorPort` — from `pom.xml` properties (default 4502)

Extract build commands from `pom.xml` and `package.json` (if frontend submodule exists):
- `build.full` — `mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage` (with correct `-pl` if multi-module)
- `build.deploy` — `mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage -DskipTests` (quick deploy, no tests)
- `build.compile` — frontend compile if `package.json` submodule exists
- `build.test` — `mvn test -pl <core-module>`
- `build.testSingle` — `mvn test -pl <core-module> -Dtest={className}`
- `build.lint` — from `package.json` scripts if frontend submodule exists

Extract modules list from child `pom.xml` files:
```bash
find . -maxdepth 3 -name "pom.xml" ! -path "./pom.xml" \
  -exec grep -l "packaging" {} \; | sort
```
For each, read packaging type: `bundle`, `content-package`, `jar`.

Extract `sourceRoots`, `testRoots`, `componentPaths` from the module paths found.

**For `aem-frontend`:**

Read `package.json` scripts to extract build, lint, test commands.
Read webpack/clientlib config to find component output paths.
No Java extraction needed — omit `aem.javaPackage`, `aem.componentSelector`, etc.

**For `frontend`:**

Read `package.json` for framework, scripts (build, test, lint, dev).
Read `tsconfig.json` if present for TypeScript confirmation.
Read directory structure (`src/`, `app/`, `pages/`, `components/`) for source roots.

### 1c. Git and SCM details

```bash
# Base branch
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||'

# Branch prefix from recent branches
git branch -r | grep -E "feature/|bugfix/" | head -5
```

Read `scm.base-branch` from `.ai/config.yaml` as fallback.

## Phase 2: Confirm with User

Print all detected values as a table. Ask: **"Correct? Type 'yes' or correct any values."**

```markdown
## Detected: <project type>

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Project Type | <type> |
| Name | <name from config.yaml> |
| Build (full) | `<command>` |
| Build (compile) | `<command or "—">` |
| Test | `<command>` |
| Test (single) | `<pattern>` |
| Lint | `<command or "none">` |
| Base Branch | <branch> |
| Source Roots | <list> |
| Test Roots | <list> |
| Component Paths | <list> |
<AEM-only rows:>
| Java Package | <package> |
| Component Path | <path> |
| Component Group | <group> |
| Selector | <selector or "—"> |
| Service Vendor | <vendor or "—"> |
| Dialog Property Prefix | <prefix> |
| AEM Author Port | <port> |
```

## Phase 3: Update .ai/config.yaml with project profile

### 3a. Derive project role

Derive `project.role` from `project.type`:

| project.type | project.role |
|---|---|
| aem-fullstack | fullstack |
| aem-frontend | frontend |
| frontend | frontend |
| java | backend |
| (other) | Ask user to confirm |

Confirm with user: "Detected project role: **{role}**. Is this correct?"

### 3b. Read existing config.yaml

Read `.ai/config.yaml` in full. You will append/update sections — never overwrite the entire file.

### 3c. Update config.yaml sections

Add or update the following sections in `.ai/config.yaml`. Preserve all existing sections (`dx:`, `scm:`, `build:`, `aem:`, etc.) — only add/update the fields listed below.

**Add `project:` section** (add after `dx:` section, or update if it already exists):

```yaml
project:
  type: "{{type}}"           # aem-fullstack | aem-frontend | frontend | java
  role: "{{role}}"           # fullstack | frontend | backend (derived above)
```

**Add `toolchain:` section** (add after `project:` section):

```yaml
toolchain:
  node-version: "{{version}}"          # detected from .nvmrc, .node-version, or package.json engines
  build-tool: "{{tool}}"               # webpack | vite | maven | gradle | etc.
  css-compiler: "{{compiler}}"         # sass | less | postcss | none
  component-base-class: "{{class}}"    # e.g. "com.adobe.cq.export.json.ComponentExporter" (AEM only, omit if N/A)
```

Only include fields that were actually detected. Omit fields with no detected value.

**Update `build:` section** — append these granular fields to the existing `build:` section if detected:

```yaml
build:
  # ... existing fields (command, test, etc.) stay as-is ...
  serve: "{{command}}"        # dev server command (e.g. "npm run dev")
  lint-js: "{{command}}"      # JS/TS linting (e.g. "npm run lint:js")
  lint-scss: "{{command}}"    # SCSS/CSS linting (e.g. "npm run lint:scss")
  lint-fix: "{{command}}"     # auto-fix linting (e.g. "npm run lint:fix")
```

Only add fields that were detected from `package.json` scripts or build configs. Do not add fields with empty values.

**Update `aem:` section** — if project type is `aem-fullstack` or `aem-frontend` and the `aem:` section already exists, add/update `component-prefix` if a prefix was detected (e.g., from component group or path convention). Do NOT duplicate fields that already exist in the `aem:` section (`java-package`, `component-path`, `component-group` are already managed by `/aem-init`).

**Fields NOT written** (derivable from filesystem, dropped per spec): `modules`, `sourceRoots`, `testRoots`, `componentPaths`, `source`, `output`, `component.registration`.

Print: `Updated .ai/config.yaml with project profile`

## Phase 4: Update Template-Seeded Files

Re-generate files seeded from plugin templates. These are the plugin's responsibility (not user-customized), so they always reflect the latest template.

### 4a. Regenerate agent.index.md

Read `templates/INDEX.md.template` from the plugin directory. Replace `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` with `dx.project-name` from `.ai/config.yaml`. Write to `agent.index.md` (project root). Always overwrite.

### 4b. Regenerate .ai/README.md

Read `templates/README.md.template` from the plugin directory. Replace `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` with the project name. Write to `.ai/README.md`. Always overwrite.

### 4c. Re-run scaffold for new static files

Run scaffold.sh to pick up any new rule templates or utilities added since last init:

```bash
bash skills/dx-init/scripts/scaffold.sh
```

Each file is skipped if it already exists — only newly added templates are installed.

## Phase 5: Filter and Verify .claude/rules/

### 5a. Filter rules by project type

Read `project.type` from `.ai/config.yaml`.

| project.type | Action |
|---|---|
| `aem-fullstack` | Keep all rules. No deletions. |
| `aem-frontend` | Delete all `be-*.md` rules in `.claude/rules/`. Keep `fe-*.md`, `accessibility.md`, `naming.md`. |
| `frontend` | Delete all `be-*.md` and `fe-clientlibs.md` rules. Keep `accessibility.md`, `naming.md`. |
| `java` | Delete all `fe-*.md` rules. Keep `be-*.md`, `accessibility.md`, `naming.md`. |

Use Glob to list matching files, then delete those that don't apply. If no files match the deletion criteria, report "no rules to filter".

### 5b. Verify project values in rules

Read each `.claude/rules/*.md` file that was installed from an aem-init template. Verify that project-specific values from `.ai/config.yaml` are present — not generic placeholders. Check for:

- Java package name (should match `aem.java-package` from config.yaml `aem:` section)
- Component path (should match `aem.component-path` from config.yaml `aem:` section)
- Component group (should match `aem.component-group` from config.yaml `aem:` section)

Other substitution values are read from `.ai/config.yaml`:
- `project.type`, `project.role` — from the `project:` section
- `toolchain.*` values — from the `toolchain:` section
- `build.*` values — from the `build:` section

If any file still contains generic examples instead of real project values, substitute them with values from `.ai/config.yaml`. If a file already has correct project-specific values, skip it silently.

## Phase 6: Report

```markdown
## Project Adapted: <name>

**Type:** <type>
**Role:** <role>
**Config:** `.ai/config.yaml` updated (project + toolchain sections)

### Rules Updated
<list of .claude/rules/ files modified with substitutions made>
<list of files skipped (already customized)>

### Next Steps
- Review `project:` and `toolchain:` sections in `.ai/config.yaml` — edit and re-run `/dx-adapt` if any values need correction
- `/dx-init` — re-run if base config.yaml needs changes
- `/aem-init` — re-run if AEM rule templates need reinstalling
```

## Examples

1. `/dx-adapt` — First run after `/dx-init`. Scans the codebase to detect 3 brands, 45 components, Node 10 with Gulp build. Updates `config.yaml` with `project:` and `toolchain:` sections, then substitutes placeholders in `.claude/rules/` files (e.g., `{{BRANDS}}` becomes the actual brand list, `{{BUILD_COMMAND}}` becomes `npm run build:new`).

2. `/dx-adapt` (re-run after adding a new brand) — Detects existing `project:` section in config.yaml, asks whether to re-detect or keep existing values. User chooses re-detect. Finds the new brand directory, updates config.yaml, and re-runs Phase 4 substitution to update rules files with the expanded brand list.

3. `/dx-adapt` (AEM project) — Detects AEM project structure during Phase 1. After Phase 3 (config.yaml updated), automatically chains to `/aem-init` to install AEM-specific rules before Phase 4 runs substitution on all rule files including AEM ones.

## Troubleshooting

- **"project profile already exists — re-detect or keep?"**
  **Cause:** `/dx-adapt` was run before and detection results are saved in config.yaml's `project:` section.
  **Fix:** Choose "re-detect" if the project structure changed (new components, new brands). Choose "keep" if you only want to re-run the substitution phase (Phase 4) with existing values.

- **Placeholders left in rule files after adaptation**
  **Cause:** The value could not be extracted from the codebase (e.g., no brands found, build tool not recognized).
  **Fix:** Check `project:` and `toolchain:` sections in `.ai/config.yaml` for missing values. Fill them in manually and re-run `/dx-adapt` — Phase 4 will substitute using the updated values.

- **Rule file skipped during substitution**
  **Cause:** The rule file has no remaining placeholders (already customized) or was manually edited.
  **Fix:** This is expected behavior — `/dx-adapt` never overwrites user customizations. If you want to re-apply the template, delete the rule file and run `/dx-adapt` again (it will reinstall from the plugin template first).

## Rules

- **Read real source files** — extract values from actual code, not defaults
- **Never overwrite user customizations** — if a rule file has no matching placeholder, skip it
- **Idempotent** — safe to re-run; Phase 0 check skips detection if config.yaml already has a `project:` section (unless user chooses re-detect)
- **Phase 4 is always run** — even if project profile already exists in config.yaml, substitution runs on re-run (user may have reinstalled rules)
- **Graceful on missing data** — if a value can't be extracted, leave the placeholder and note it in the report
