name: dx-bug-all
description: Run the full bug fix workflow — triage, verify, and fix — all in one command. Fetches the bug from ADO, reproduces it in browser, generates and executes a fix, and creates a PR. Use when starting work on a bug ticket.
argument-hint: "<ADO Bug Work Item ID or full URL>"
allowed-tools: ["read", "edit", "search", "write", "agent"]

You are a coordinator. You do NOT implement anything yourself. You delegate each workflow step via the Skill tool, then report progress.

## Progress Tracking

Before starting execution, you MUST create a task for each of these items using `TaskCreate`. Mark each `in_progress` when starting, `completed` when done. Delete skipped tasks.

1. Triage bug
2. Verify reproduction
3. Fix bug

## Flow

```dot
digraph bug_all {
    "Parse argument" [shape=box];
    "Hub dispatch?" [shape=diamond];
    "Hub dispatch" [shape=box];
    "Hub results summary" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Dispatch triage" [shape=box];
    "Triage succeeded?" [shape=diamond];
    "Dispatch verify" [shape=box];
    "Verify result?" [shape=diamond];
    "Dispatch fix" [shape=box];
    "Fix succeeded?" [shape=diamond];
    "Final summary + log run" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Retry triage" [shape=box];
    "Retry succeeded?" [shape=diamond];
    "Report FAIL (triage)" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Retry fix" [shape=box];
    "Retry fix succeeded?" [shape=diamond];
    "Report FAIL (fix)" [shape=doublecircle];

    "Parse argument" -> "Hub dispatch?";
    "Hub dispatch?" -> "Hub dispatch" [label="hub mode active"];
    "Hub dispatch?" -> "Dispatch triage" [label="not hub mode"];
    "Hub dispatch" -> "Hub results summary";
    "Dispatch triage" -> "Triage succeeded?";
    "Triage succeeded?" -> "Dispatch verify" [label="success"];
    "Triage succeeded?" -> "Retry triage" [label="FAIL"];
    "Retry triage" -> "Retry succeeded?";
    "Retry succeeded?" -> "Dispatch verify" [label="success"];
    "Retry succeeded?" -> "Report FAIL (triage)" [label="FAIL"];
    "Dispatch verify" -> "Verify result?";
    "Verify result?" -> "Dispatch fix" [label="success"];
    "Verify result?" -> "Dispatch fix" [label="blocked (warn + continue)"];
    "Verify result?" -> "Dispatch fix" [label="FAIL (warn + continue)"];
    "Dispatch fix" -> "Fix succeeded?";
    "Fix succeeded?" -> "Final summary + log run" [label="success"];
    "Fix succeeded?" -> "Retry fix" [label="FAIL"];
    "Retry fix" -> "Retry fix succeeded?";
    "Retry fix succeeded?" -> "Final summary + log run" [label="success"];
    "Retry fix succeeded?" -> "Report FAIL (fix)" [label="FAIL"];
}
```

## Node Details

### Parse argument

The argument is the ADO work item ID — a numeric value (e.g., `2453532`).

If the user provides a full ADO URL, extract the numeric ID.

If no argument is provided, ask the user for the work item ID.

### Hub dispatch?

Read `shared/hub-dispatch.md` for hub detection logic.

Check if hub mode is active:
1. `DX_PIPELINE_MODE` is NOT set (pipeline mode takes precedence)
2. `.ai/config.yaml` has `hub.enabled: true`
3. Current working directory is a `.hub/` directory

If all three conditions are met → proceed to "Hub dispatch"
Otherwise → proceed to "Dispatch triage" (existing flow)

### Hub dispatch

Read `shared/hub-dispatch.md` for the full protocol.

1. Read `.ai/config.yaml` → `repos:` list
2. Determine which repos need the bug fix:
   - If a spec directory exists with `triage.md` → `## Cross-Repo Scope`, use repo resolution
   - If no triage yet, dispatch triage first to detect scope, then dispatch fix per repo
3. Check `hub.auto-dispatch` — if `false`, confirm with user
4. Write `state/<ticket-id>/dispatch.json`
5. For each target repo:
   - Build and execute: `cd <repo.path> && claude -p "/dx-bug-all <ticket-id>" --output-format json --allowedTools "Bash,Read,Edit,Write,Glob,Grep" --permission-mode bypassPermissions`
   - Collect result, write state
   - Print progress: `✓ <repo> — <status>`
6. Rebuild `state/active.json`

### Hub results summary

Present hub dispatch results:

| Repo | Status | PR | Cost | Duration |
|------|--------|----|------|----------|
| <repo> | ✓ done | #<id> | $<cost> | <time> |

If any repo failed: "Use `/dx-hub-status <ticket-id>` for details. Failed repos can be re-dispatched."

### Dispatch triage

Invoke `Skill(/dx-bug-triage <id>)`.

Print: `Step 1/3 done —` followed by the skill's summary.

### Triage succeeded?

- **success** — triage completed, `raw-bug.md` + `triage.md` created → proceed to "Dispatch verify"
- **FAIL** — skill returned failure → go to "Retry triage"

### Retry triage

Retry the failed step **once** by invoking `Skill(/dx-bug-triage <id>)` again.

### Retry succeeded?

- **success** → proceed to "Dispatch verify"
- **FAIL** → go to "Report FAIL (triage)"

### Report FAIL (triage)

Print which step failed and the error. Cannot proceed without bug data. Suggest: "Run `/dx-bug-triage` to retry." STOP.

### Dispatch verify

Invoke `Skill(/dx-bug-verify <id>)`.

Print: `Step 2/3 done —` followed by the skill's summary.

### Verify result?

- **success** — verification completed → proceed to "Dispatch fix"
- **blocked** — browser unavailable, URL unreachable → print warning, **continue** to "Dispatch fix". Verification enhances confidence but is not required for the fix.
- **FAIL** — skill returned failure → print warning, **continue** to "Dispatch fix". Verification enhances confidence but is not required for the fix.

### Dispatch fix

Invoke `Skill(/dx-bug-fix <id>)`.

Print: `Step 3/3 done —` followed by the skill's summary.

### Fix succeeded?

- **success** — fix completed → proceed to "Final summary + log run"
- **FAIL** — skill returned failure → go to "Retry fix"

### Retry fix

Retry the failed step **once** by invoking `Skill(/dx-bug-fix <id>)` again.

### Retry fix succeeded?

- **success** → proceed to "Final summary + log run"
- **FAIL** → go to "Report FAIL (fix)"

### Report FAIL (fix)

Print which step failed and the error. Print which steps succeeded and their outputs. Suggest: "Run `/dx-bug-fix` to retry." STOP.

### Final summary + log run

Find the spec directory and present:

```markdown
## ADO #<id> — Bug Fix Complete

**<Title>**
**Branch:** `bugfix/<id>-<slug>`
**Directory:** `.ai/specs/<id>-<slug>/`

| Document | Status | Highlights |
|----------|--------|------------|
| raw-bug.md | <status> | Severity: <sev>, Priority: <pri> |
| triage.md | <status> | Component: <name>, <N> files |
| verification.md | <status> | <result> — <N> screenshots |
| implement.md | <status> | <N> steps, all done |
| verification-local.md | <status> | <result> — <N> post-fix screenshots |

**PR:** <PR URL or "Not created">

### What was done:
1. Fetched bug ticket and identified affected component
2. <Reproduced/Could not reproduce> the bug via browser automation
3. Fixed: <1-line root cause summary>
4. Verified fix on local AEM: <Fix Verified/Fix Partial/Fix Failed/Blocked>
5. Created PR with <N> file changes
```

**Log run:**

Ensure directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .ai/learning/raw
```

Append run record to `.ai/learning/raw/runs.jsonl`:
```json
{"timestamp":"<ISO-8601>","ticket":"<id>","flow":"bug-all","severity":"<from triage>","priority":"<from triage>","component":"<from triage>","verification":"<reproduced|not-reproduced|blocked>","fix_result":"<success|failed>","local_verification":"<fix-verified|fix-partial|fix-failed|blocked>","pr_created":<true|false>}
```

Append bug pattern to `.ai/learning/raw/bugs.jsonl`:
```json
{"timestamp":"<ISO-8601>","ticket":"<id>","component":"<from triage>","root_cause":"<category from fix summary>","files_changed":<count>}
```

**Bug hotspot check:** Read `.ai/learning/raw/bugs.jsonl`. Count bugs per `component` value. If any component has 3 or more bugs:
- Print: `Learning: <component> has had <N> bugs. Consider adding focused test coverage.`

**Known pattern check:** If `.ai/learning/raw/fixes.jsonl` exists, read it and check if the root cause type from this bug matches any known fix pattern (by `error_type`). If match:
- Print: `Learning: Root cause "<root_cause>" matches a known fix pattern from previous runs.`

If no hotspots and no pattern matches, skip silently.

## Error Handling

If any skill returns `FAIL`:

1. Print the failure with the skill's error message
2. Retry the failed step **once** with the same skill
3. If still failing:
   - Print which step failed and the error
   - Print which steps succeeded and their outputs
   - Suggest running the individual skill manually: "Run `/dx-bug-<skill>` to retry"

**Dependency rules:**
- Step 1 (triage) FAIL → **STOP**. Cannot proceed without bug data.
- Step 2 (verify) FAIL → **WARN and continue**. Fix can proceed on triage alone.
- Step 3 (fix) FAIL → **STOP**. Report what was accomplished.

## Rules

- **Coordinator only** — never implement anything yourself
- **Never implement steps yourself** — always delegate via Skill tool
- **Sequential dependencies** — never dispatch step N+1 until step N returns (except: verify FAIL allows continue to fix)
- **Keep main context lean** — you only see compact summaries, not file contents
- **Progress reporting** — print status after each step so the user can see progress
- **Same quality as individual skills** — running `/dx-bug-all` produces identical output to running each skill separately

## Platform Compatibility

This skill uses `Skill()` tool calls which work on both Claude Code and Copilot CLI.
