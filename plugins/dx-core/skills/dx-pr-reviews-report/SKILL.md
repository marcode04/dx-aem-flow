You generate review reports for multiple pull requests. By default, lists PRs where the current user is a reviewer (excluding own PRs) and processes them in parallel. With `--any`, lists all PRs with review threads without filtering and processes sequentially with user selection.

## Modes

| Mode | Filter | Processing | User Prompt |
|------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Mine** (default) | `i_am_reviewer: true`, exclude own PRs | Parallel (all at once) | No — auto-generates all |
| **Any** (`--any` flag) | All PRs with review threads, no author filter | Sequential with selection | Yes — user picks which PRs |

## Defaults

Read `shared/ado-config.md` and `shared/provider-config.md` for how to look up project config from `.ai/config.yaml`.

- **Provider:** read from `.ai/config.yaml` `tracker.provider` — `ado` (default) or `jira`
- **Organization:** read from `.ai/config.yaml` `scm.org` — NEVER hardcode
- **Project:** read from `.ai/config.yaml` `scm.project`
- **Confluence space (Jira):** read from `.ai/config.yaml` `confluence.space-key`
- **Confluence PR review root (Jira):** read from `.ai/config.yaml` `confluence.pr-review-root`

## 1. Parse Input

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the mode:

### Flag detection

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--any`, remove it from the arguments and set `MODE=any`. Otherwise `MODE=mine`.

### Remaining arguments

| Input | Mode | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| *(empty)* | Current repo, default count | `/dx-pr-reviews-report` (mine, 5 PRs) |
| `<number>` | Current repo, N PRs | `/dx-pr-reviews-report 5` |
| `--any` | Current repo, any mode, 10 PRs | `/dx-pr-reviews-report --any` |
| `--any <number>` | Current repo, any mode, N PRs | `/dx-pr-reviews-report --any 20` |
| `<repo URL>` | That repo, default count | `/dx-pr-reviews-report https://{org}/_git/My-Repo` |
| `<repo URL> <number>` | That repo, N PRs | `/dx-pr-reviews-report https://{org}/_git/My-Repo 20` |
| `<PR URL>` | Single PR (delegate) | `/dx-pr-reviews-report https://.../_git/.../pullrequest/12345` |

**Default count:** 5 for mine mode, 10 for any mode.

### Detect PR URL vs Repo URL

- Contains `/pullrequest/` → **single PR mode** — skip to step 4 and invoke `/dx-pr-review-report <URL>` directly.
- Contains `/_git/` but no `/pullrequest/` → **repo URL** — extract project and repo name from the URL. URL-decode the project. **The URL-extracted project takes precedence over the config default.**
- Numeric only → **count** for current repo

### Detect current repo

When no URL is provided, detect the repo from the git remote:

```bash
git remote get-url origin
```

Extract the repo name from the URL:
- `vs-ssh.visualstudio.com:v3/{org}/{project}/{repo}` → repo name is the last segment
- `{org}.visualstudio.com/{project}/_git/{repo}` → repo name after `_git/`

## 2. Load MCP Tools & Resolve Repo

Before any ADO calls, load the tools:

```
ToolSearch("+ado repo")
ToolSearch("+ado pull request thread")
ToolSearch("+ado wiki")
```

Resolve the repo name to an ID:

```
mcp__ado__repo_get_repo_by_name_or_id
  project: "<project from URL if provided, otherwise from config>"
  repositoryNameOrId: "<repo name>"
```

Save the `id` field — needed for all subsequent calls.

Also resolve the current user identity:

```bash
git config user.email
```

## 3. List PRs

### Mine mode (default)

Fetch PRs where the current user is a reviewer:

```
mcp__ado__repo_list_pull_requests_by_repo_or_project
  repositoryId: "<repo ID>"
  status: "All"
  i_am_reviewer: true
  top: <count * 2>
```

**Filter out own PRs:** Compare each PR's `createdBy.uniqueName` (case-insensitive) against the current user email from `git config user.email`. Remove matches — you don't need a report for your own PRs. Take the first `<count>` PRs after filtering (fetch extra to compensate for filtered-out PRs).

**Filter to PRs with meaningful review comments.** For each remaining PR, fetch threads:

```
mcp__ado__repo_list_pull_request_threads
  repositoryId: "<repo ID>"
  pullRequestId: <PR ID>
```

Skip PRs where **all threads are system-generated** (status updates, vote changes, policy evaluations, auto-complete). Only keep PRs that have at least one thread with an actual review comment. PRs with no meaningful comments don't need a report — mark them as `SKIP (no comments)` in the PR list.

### Any mode (`--any`)

Fetch recent PRs regardless of reviewer:

```
mcp__ado__repo_list_pull_requests_by_repo_or_project
  repositoryId: "<repo ID>"
  status: "All"
  top: <count>
```

Then filter to PRs with review threads — for each PR:

```
mcp__ado__repo_list_pull_request_threads
  repositoryId: "<repo ID>"
  pullRequestId: <PR ID>
```

Keep only PRs that have **at least one non-system review thread** (actual code review comments, not just status updates or vote changes).

### Check for existing reports

Use the helper script to check which PRs already have reports:

```bash
bash scripts/check-existing-reports.sh <pr-id-1> <pr-id-2> ...
```

Returns JSON: `[{"prId": N, "exists": true/false, "path": "..."}]`

### Present PR List

```markdown
## PRs <with My Reviews | with Reviews> — <repo name> (<count> found)

| # | PR | Title | Author | Status | Report |
|---|-----|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | [#12345](url) | Fix login bug | John D. | Completed | NEW |
| 2 | [#12346](url) | Add feature X | Jane S. | Active | EXISTS |
| 3 | [#12347](url) | Update styles | Bob K. | Completed | NEW |
| 4 | [#12348](url) | Config change | Alice W. | Completed | SKIP (no comments) |
```

For each PR show:
- **PR number** with link
- **Title** — truncated to 60 chars if needed
- **Author** — display name
- **Status** — Active / Completed / Abandoned
- **Report** — `NEW` (no report exists), `EXISTS` (report already generated), or `SKIP (no comments)` (no meaningful review comments — report not needed)

### Handle empty list

If no PRs found:
- Mine mode: "No PRs where you are a reviewer in <repo name>." and stop.
- Any mode: "No reviewed PRs in <repo name>." and stop.

### User confirmation

- **Mine mode:** Show the list, then proceed automatically — no selection prompt. Skip PRs marked `SKIP (no comments)`. Print: "Generating reports for <N> PRs (skipping <M> with no comments)..."
- **Any mode:** Show the list and ask: `Generate reports for which PRs? (e.g., "all", "1 3", "new only")`

## 4. Generate Reports

### Mine mode — Parallel Processing

Build the PR URL for each PR:
```
PR_URL = "<scm.org>/<project>/_git/<repo>/pullrequest/<id>"
```

Read wiki config from `.ai/config.yaml`:
- `tracker.provider` — `ado` (default) or `jira`
- `scm.wiki-id` — wiki identifier (ADO)
- `scm.wiki-project` — project that owns the wiki (ADO)
- `scm.wiki-pr-review-root` — parent page path (ADO)
- `confluence.space-key` — Confluence space key (Jira)
- `confluence.pr-review-root` — parent page title for PR reviews (Jira)

Spawn **one Agent per PR**, all in a single message (parallel execution):

```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  description: "PR report #<id>",
  prompt: "You are generating a PR review report. Follow the dx-pr-review-report skill logic exactly.

## Your task
Generate a categorized report for PR #<id> and post it to wiki.

## Config
- Provider: <tracker.provider>   # ado or jira
- Organization: <scm.org>
- Project: <project>
- Repository ID: <repo ID>
- Repository name: <repo name>
- PR ID: <id>
### ADO Wiki (if provider = ado)
- Wiki ID: <scm.wiki-id>
- Wiki project: <scm.wiki-project>
- Wiki PR review root: <scm.wiki-pr-review-root>
### Confluence (if provider = jira)
- Confluence space key: <confluence.space-key>
- Confluence PR review root: <confluence.pr-review-root>

## Report template
Read the report template from: <absolute path to plugin>/skills/dx-pr-review-report/assets/report-template.md
Use this template structure for the output — replace {{PLACEHOLDER}} tokens with actual PR data.

## Steps

1. Load MCP tools: ToolSearch('+ado repo'), ToolSearch('+ado pull request thread'), ToolSearch('+ado wiki'), ToolSearch('+ado work item'). If provider = jira, also: ToolSearch('+atlassian confluence')

2. Fetch PR details via mcp__ado__repo_get_pull_request_by_id. Extract title, author, reviewers, status, dates, work item links.

3. Resolve linked work item if present — check PR description for #12345 patterns, fetch via mcp__ado__wit_get_work_item.

4. Fetch all review threads via mcp__ado__repo_list_pull_request_threads. For each thread, fetch full comments via mcp__ado__repo_list_pull_request_thread_comments (fullResponse: true).

5. Filter to meaningful threads — skip system-generated threads (status updates, vote changes). Keep threads with actual review comments.

6. Categorize each comment into: Accessibility, Bug, Security, Regression, Functionality, Performance, Code Quality, Convention.

7. Read the report template, fill in the data, write to .ai/pr-reviews/reports/pr-<id>-report.md.
   Key formatting: each finding line includes *(reviewer: <comment author name>)* after the issue summary.
   Omit categories with 0 findings. Omit Patch Resolution if no patches. Sort categories by count desc.

8. Post to wiki based on provider:
   **If provider = ado:**
   - Page path: <wiki-pr-review-root>/<ticket-number> - <meaningful-title>
   - Check parent exists (mcp__ado__wiki_get_page), create if needed
   - Create page via mcp__ado__wiki_create_or_update_page
   **If provider = jira (Confluence):**
   - Find parent page: mcp__atlassian__confluence_search with CQL for <confluence.pr-review-root> in <confluence.space-key>
   - Convert markdown to Confluence storage format (XHTML) if server doesn't accept markdown
   - Create via mcp__atlassian__confluence_create_page or update via mcp__atlassian__confluence_update_page

9. Return a JSON summary line at the END of your response in this exact format:
REPORT_SUMMARY: {\"prId\": <id>, \"title\": \"<title>\", \"ticket\": \"<ticket or none>\", \"categories\": \"<e.g. 2 Bug, 1 A11Y>\", \"comments\": <total>, \"findings\": <meaningful>, \"patches\": \"<P proposed, F fixed>\", \"wiki\": \"<Posted or Local>\", \"reportPath\": \".ai/pr-reviews/reports/pr-<id>-report.md\"}
"
)
```

### Any mode — Sequential Processing

Process each selected PR by invoking `/dx-pr-review-report`:

```
Skill("dx-pr-review-report", args: "<PR URL or ID>")
```

Between each PR, print a separator:

```markdown
---
### Report <N> of <M>: PR #<id> — <title>
```

### Wiki Posting

- **Mine mode:** Each parallel agent handles its own wiki posting using the config values passed in the prompt. The agent uses ADO wiki or Confluence based on the `provider` value in the config block.
- **Any mode:** After each report is generated, if the user requested wiki posting (or `PIPELINE_MODE=true`), the individual `/dx-pr-review-report` skill handles wiki creation (ADO or Confluence based on `tracker.provider`). If the user said "all to wiki" at the start, pass this intent through to each invocation.

## 5. Print Summary

After all reports are generated (all agents complete in mine mode, or all sequential reports in any mode), print an aggregate summary:

```markdown
## PR Review Reports — <repo name> (<mine | any> mode)

| # | PR | Title | Ticket | Categories | Comments | Patches | Wiki |
|---|-----|-------|--------|------------|----------|---------|------|
| 1 | #12345 | Fix login bug | #2416553 | 2 Bug, 1 A11Y | 5 | 2/3 fixed | Posted |
| 2 | #12346 | Add feature X | #2437173 | 3 Func, 1 Perf | 8 | 1/1 fixed | Posted |
| 3 | #12347 | Update styles | — | 2 Convention | 3 | 0 | Local |

**Reports generated:** <N> | **Skipped (no comments):** <M>
**Total findings:** <sum across all PRs>
**Most common category:** <top category with count>
**Output:** .ai/pr-reviews/reports/pr-<id>-report.md
**Wiki:** <N posted to wiki> / <M local only>
```

For mine mode, parse the `REPORT_SUMMARY` JSON line from each agent's response to build the summary table.

## Examples

1. `/dx-pr-reviews-report 5` — Fetches last 5 PRs where you are a reviewer (excluding your own PRs). Pre-filters to PRs with meaningful review comments — skips PRs with only system threads (approvals, policy updates). Generates reports in parallel for the remaining PRs, posts each to ADO wiki.

2. `/dx-pr-reviews-report` — Same as above with default count of 5.

3. `/dx-pr-reviews-report --any 20` — Lists up to 20 PRs from the current repo that have review threads (any reviewer). User selects which to report. Generates reports sequentially.

4. `/dx-pr-reviews-report --any https://dev.azure.com/myorg/MyProject/_git/Other-Repo 20` — Lists up to 20 PRs from a different repo that have review threads. Generates reports for selected PRs.

5. `/dx-pr-reviews-report https://dev.azure.com/myorg/MyProject/_git/MyRepo/pullrequest/12345` — Detects a single PR URL, skips the listing step, and delegates directly to `/dx-pr-review-report` for that specific PR.

## Troubleshooting

- **"No PRs where you are a reviewer in <repo>"**
  **Cause:** You haven't been added as a reviewer on any recent PRs in this repo.
  **Fix:** Check if you're reviewing PRs in a different repo, or use `--any` to see all reviewed PRs.

- **"No reviewed PRs in <repo>"** (any mode)
  **Cause:** None of the recent PRs have review comment threads.
  **Fix:** Run `/dx-pr-reviews` first to review PRs, then generate reports.

- **"Report already exists for PR #<id>"**
  **Cause:** A previous run already generated a report.
  **Fix:** The PR shows `EXISTS` in the list. In mine mode it regenerates automatically. In any mode, select it to regenerate.

- **Wiki posting fails for some PRs**
  **Cause:** Wiki permissions or path issues. The skill logs failures and continues with remaining PRs.
  **Fix:** Check `scm.wiki-pr-review-root` in config and verify wiki access permissions.

- **Parallel agent fails for one PR**
  **Cause:** MCP tool error or PR data issue for that specific PR.
  **Fix:** The other agents continue independently. Check the failed agent's output for details. Retry the failed PR with `/dx-pr-review-report <PR URL>`.

## Rules

- **Mine by default** — without `--any`, filter to PRs where current user is reviewer, exclude own PRs (compare `createdBy.uniqueName` vs `git config user.email`)
- **Parallel for mine** — spawn one agent per PR, all in a single message for concurrent execution
- **Sequential for any** — process one at a time via `/dx-pr-review-report` with user selection, no author filtering
- **Auto-proceed for mine** — no selection prompt, generate all reports automatically
- **Selection for any** — show list and let the user choose which to report on
- **Skip existing reports** — mark PRs with existing reports but don't skip them automatically (let user decide in any mode; regenerate in mine mode)
- **Include all PR statuses** — don't limit to active only. Completed PRs with reviews are the main use case
- **Aggregate summary** — always show the cross-PR summary table at the end
- **Current repo as default** — when no arguments, detect repo from git remote
- **Identity from git** — resolve current user via `git config user.email`
- **MCP tools are deferred** — always load via ToolSearch before first use
- **No hardcoded values** — read all project-specific values from `.ai/config.yaml`
- **Config-driven wiki** — wiki path from `scm.wiki-pr-review-root`, never hardcode
