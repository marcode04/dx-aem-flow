overview: "Every agent gets exactly the model it needs — no more, no less. Our code reviewer uses Opus ($15/M tokens) because judgment quality matters. Our PR reviewer uses Sonnet ($3/M tokens) for implementation. Our file resolver uses Haiku ($0.25/M tokens) for speed. Wrong tier = wasted money or poor quality."

  🤖 Agentic AI Tip #23 — Agent Model Tiering: Cost vs Quality
  
  We run 12 agents across 4 plugins. Only ONE uses Opus. Here's why.
  
  *Opus ($15/M tokens) — 1 agent:*
  `dx-code-reviewer` — Reviews code with confidence scoring. Needs deep reasoning to distinguish real bugs from style preferences. Worth the cost because a bad review wastes more human time than the tokens cost.
  
  *Sonnet ($3/M tokens) — 7 agents:*
  `dx-pr-reviewer`, `aem-inspector`, `aem-demo-capture`, etc. — These need good judgment AND they need to take actions (read files, run commands, edit code). Sonnet is the sweet spot.
  
  *Haiku ($0.25/M tokens) — 4 agents:*
  `dx-file-resolver`, `dx-doc-searcher`, `aem-file-resolver`, `aem-page-finder` — Pure lookups. "Find files matching this pattern." No reasoning needed, just fast execution.
  
  *The math:*
  If a pipeline spawns all 12 agents, using Opus for all of them costs ~60x more than our tiered approach. For a team running 50 pipelines/day, that's the difference between $500/month and $30,000/month.
  
  💡 Try it: Review your agent definitions. Is any agent using a model tier higher than it needs?
