overview: "Individual skills are building blocks. The real power comes from chaining them into pipelines. req → plan → execute → verify → PR. Each step reads the previous step's output. You can run the full pipeline or any individual step."

  🤖 Agentic AI Tip #20 — Chaining Skills: Building Pipelines
  
  Individual skills are useful. Chained skills are transformative.
  
  Here's a real pipeline that takes a ticket from ADO to a pull request:

  ```
  /dx-req 12345           → full requirements pipeline (fetch, DoR, explain, research, share)
  /dx-plan                → generates implementation plan
  /dx-step                → executes step 1
  /dx-step                → executes step 2...
  /dx-step-verify         → 6-phase verification
  /dx-pr                  → creates the pull request
  ```

  *Key insight:* You don't have to run the full pipeline. Each skill is independent:
  • Want to code manually? Skip `/dx-step`, just use `/dx-plan` as a guide
  • Already coded? Jump straight to `/dx-step-verify`
  
  This modularity is intentional. The pipeline is a *suggestion*, not a requirement. Use what helps, skip what doesn't.
  
  *The coordinator version:* `/dx-agent-all` runs the entire pipeline as a single command using the coordinator pattern. Great for simple stories. Use individual steps for complex ones.
  
  💡 Try it: Pick a small ticket and run the first three skills: fetch, explain, research. Review each output before moving forward.

# Full pipeline for a feature:
/dx-req 12345     # full requirements pipeline
/dx-plan
/dx-step          # execute step 1
/dx-step          # execute step 2
/dx-step-verify
/dx-pr
```
