  🤖 Agentic AI Tip #7 — CLAUDE.md: Your Project's Brain
  
  This is the single highest-ROI file you can create for AI-assisted development.
  
  `CLAUDE.md` lives at your project root and is automatically loaded into every Claude Code session. Think of it as your project's operating manual — but for AI.
  
  *What to put in it:*
  • *Build commands* — so AI can compile and test without guessing
  • *Project structure* — which directories contain what
  • *Naming conventions* — how you name files, components, branches
  • *Architecture patterns* — the decisions behind your code
  • *Gotchas* — things that trip up newcomers (and AI)
  
  *What NOT to put:*
  • Things derivable from code (function signatures, imports)
  • Git history (use git log)
  • Temporary notes (use tasks instead)
  
  *Why it matters:*
  Without CLAUDE.md, every AI session starts from zero — the AI guesses your conventions and gets them wrong. With it, the AI behaves like a team member who's read the onboarding docs.
  
  The file compounds in value. Every gotcha you add saves time in every future session.
  
  💡 Try it: Create a CLAUDE.md with your project's build command and one naming convention. Watch the difference in AI responses.
