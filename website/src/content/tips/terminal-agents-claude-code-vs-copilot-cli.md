title: "Terminal Agents: Claude Code vs Copilot CLI"
category: "Meet Your AI Tools"
focus: "Claude Code · CLI"
tags: ["Claude Code","Copilot CLI","Terminal"]
overview: "Both Claude Code and Copilot CLI are terminal-native autonomous agents. Claude Code has 1M token context, worktree isolation, and persistent memory. Copilot CLI (GA Feb 2026) has /fleet for parallel subagents, multi-model support (Claude + GPT + Gemini), and cloud delegation. Same 69 skills run in both."

slackOneLiner: "🤖 Tip #3 — Both Claude Code and Copilot CLI are terminal-native agents running the same 69 skills. Pick by superpower, not capability."
keyPointsTitle: "Two Agents, Different Superpowers"
keyPoints:
  - "Both are terminal-native agents running the same 69 skills with the same MCP servers — but each has distinct superpowers."
  - |
    Claude Code strengths
    - 1M token context (with Opus) — 8x more than most models
    - Worktree isolation — agents get their own repo copy
    - Persistent memory across sessions
    - 13 plugin agents with model tiering (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
    - Full hook system (18 events + prompt hooks)
    - Checkpoint rollback and @import in CLAUDE.md
  - |
    Copilot CLI strengths (GA Feb 2026)
    - Multi-model: Claude, GPT, Gemini — switch mid-session with /model
    - /fleet: run same task across multiple subagents in parallel
    - Plan mode (Shift+Tab): structured planning before coding
    - Cloud delegation: prefix with & to offload to cloud agents
    - Cross-session memory (remembers conventions)
    - 25 Copilot agents (vs 13 in Claude Code)
actionItemsTitle: "When to Use Which"
actionItems:
  - |
    Match tool to task
    - Deep architecture work → Claude Code (1M context)
    - Multi-model comparison → Copilot CLI (switch models)
    - Parallel subtasks → Copilot CLI (/fleet)
    - Plugin development → Claude Code (hooks + worktree)
  - |
    Pick your terminal agent based on your primary need
    - Need depth and isolation → Claude Code
    - Need model variety and parallelism → Copilot CLI
  - "Run the same /dx-plan on a ticket in both tools — compare how they approach the problem with different models"
  - "Try both for a week before settling on a default — they're complementary, not competing"
