overview: "You don't build a plugin in a day. Start with one skill solving one pain point. Add an agent when you need a different model tier. Add hooks when you need guardrails. Add MCP when you need external systems. Bundle as a plugin when 2+ projects need the same tools. Our plugins evolved over months, not days."

  🤖 Agentic AI Tip #51 — Your Plugin Journey: Zero to Production
  
  You've made it to Day 50! Here's the meta-lesson from building 69 skills across 4 plugins.
  
  *Don't plan a plugin. Grow one.*
  
  *Month 1: Solve one pain point*
  Create a single skill that saves you 10 minutes per day. A build checker, a component verifier, a convention reminder. One file. Done.
  
  *Month 2: Add related skills*
  As you use the first skill, you'll notice patterns. "I always do X before Y." Write a skill for X too. Add rules for your conventions.
  
  *Month 3: Add agents*
  Some tasks need a different model tier. Your build checker (Haiku) is different from your code reviewer (Opus). Create agent definitions.
  
  *Month 4: Add guardrails*
  You'll make a mistake — commit on the wrong branch, edit a config file incorrectly. Add hooks to prevent it structurally.
  
  *Month 5: Package and share*
  If two projects need the same skills, bundle them as a plugin. Write a sync script. Version it.
  
  *The key insight:*
  Our plugins didn't start as "let's build a comprehensive AI development platform." They started as "I'm tired of typing the same build command." Everything else grew from there.
  
  Start small. Ship today. Iterate tomorrow.
  
  💡 Try it: Write your first skill. Right now. Today. That's your Day 1.
